### Profile

I am a PhD research fellow advised by Prof. Sigurd Skogestad, Ass. Prof. Johannes JÃ¤schke at the Department of Chemical Engineering, NTNU. I am currently working on Modelling, Optimization, and Control of Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS).

Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ-2016) and Master of Science in Chemical Engineering at COPPE/UFRJ (UFRJ-2019).

My most recent position was as an external researcher at NTNU funded by International Partnerships for Excellence Education, Research and Innovation (INTPART). I applied a gray-box identification method in an oil production system with two gas-lift wells.
