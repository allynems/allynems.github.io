### Profile

As a certified and experienced Product Owner, I had contributed to the development and deployment of digital solutions, including OFFA (Optimal and Flexible Field Architecture), an evolutionary algorithm to fast screening of concepts to the offshore industry in a commercial software. With over a year of experience in this role, I leveraged expertise in requirements definition, backlog management, communication between quality, development and product specification teams, and retrospectives to align product outcomes with client needs.  

My background includes a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering and extensive research experience, which I integrate into my work to bridge technical knowledge with product innovation. Certified as a Scrum Product OwnerÂ®, I am committed to fostering collaboration and delivering impactful digital tools for the final clients (main users).
